# Project - Getting and Cleaning Data 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The principles applied come from **Hadley Wickham's Tidy data paper**

## Files in Repo

**readme.md** Self explanatory, it's this file and it explains what the repo contains.
**run_analysis.R** R script used to process and tidy the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) from [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

All **data sources** and **data outputs** will be in the **data** folder.
